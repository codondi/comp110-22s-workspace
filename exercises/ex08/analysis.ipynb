When brainstorming, try not to be critical of the ideas you come up with regarding scale, stakeholders impacted, or for any other reasons. In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each brainstormed idea should state a. the suggested change or addition, b. what the expected value created, and c. which specific stakeholders would benefit.  If helpful, expand on the following template \"The course should (state idea here) because it will (state value created here) for (insert stakeholders here).\"\n",

    "4. The course should require students to go to tutoring since it is effective and will help students learn the material in the class.\n",
    "5. The course should take place over monday, wednesday, and friday, because students will be able to learn topics over more class days which will increase their familiarity with the content."

One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it.
